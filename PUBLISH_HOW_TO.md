# 🚀 Packages Publishing

### Stable / Beta versions

We could publish packages with the following options:

- `latest` - stable version
- `beta` - for beta testers. This version is available for the public

To switch between release modes, you could use the following commands:

- `latest` - our default, but if we're in `beta` mode, you could switch to `stable` by running:
  ```bash
  yarn changeset pre exit
  ```
- For the `beta` releases run:
  ```bash
  yarn changeset pre enter beta
  ```

### 📚 Publishing

Ensure you have a NPM account and this account is added to the `@openapi-qraft` organization.

1. Login to NPM: `yarn npm login --scope openapi-qraft`
2. Create new branch `packages-version-update(-<version>)` from the `main` branch.
3. Run `yarn install --immutable`
4. Run `yarn build` to validate that packages are building correctly.
5. Run Changesets versioning:
   ```bash
   .changeset/version.sh
   ```
6. Push your `packages-version-update(-<version>)` branch that were created on step 2 to the `origin`,
   and create a new Merge Request into `main`.
   Review it and merge.
7. Checkout `main` branch
8. Run `yarn build` to rebuild packages with the updated versions.
9. Run command below and answer <kbd>Y</kbd>:
   ```bash
   .changeset/publish.sh
   ```
10. Create the Git tags and push them to the `origin`:
    ```bash
    yarn changeset tag
    ```
11. Profit! 🎉

> 🚫 We don't use `changeset publish`. Instead, we utilize Yarn
> for publishing. This allows us to replace the `workspace:~`
> with a standard version syntax in our dependencies.

### 🔐 Authentication with the `npm_TOKEN`

Add NPM Auth Token into `~/.yarnrc.yml`:

```bash
yarn config set 'npmScopes["openapi-qraft"]' --home \
  --json '{"npmAuthToken":"npm_YOUR_TOKEN", "npmAlwaysAuth":true}'
```

> 📍 **Place** `.yarnrc.yml` file in the directory above the application directory
> or in the user's $HOME directory.
> In this case, `npmScopes` will be inherited by the Yarn.

### 🧪 Pre-releases

**Please read the documentation carefully before using pre-releases:**
[🔗 Changesets pre-releases](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/prereleases.md)

Manually publishing pre-releases is done in the same way as for regular releases. 🔄

The only difference is that you will need to manually commit the `pre.json` file (created on `yarn changeset pre enter <tag>`).

> ⚠️ Warning! Pre-releases are very complicated! Using them requires a thorough
> understanding of all parts of npm publishes. Mistakes can lead to
> repository and publish states that are very difficult to fix.
