**Plugin Support in CLI**: Introduced the `--plugin <name>` option in the OpenAPI Qraft CLI to allow users to specify
plugins such as `tanstack-query-react` for React service generation and `openapi-typescript` for TypeScript type
generation. This enhancement provides greater flexibility and customization options in the API generation process. The
CLI now supports using multiple plugins simultaneously, enhancing the tool's versatility for developers.
